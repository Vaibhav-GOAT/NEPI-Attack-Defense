abstract: >
  This repository provides the official implementation of Narrative-Embedded Prompt Injection (NEPI),
  a novel prompt injection technique that embeds adversarial intent within fictional narratives, role-play,
  and dialogue structures. It also includes a hybrid defense framework based on prompt classification,
  suspicious prompt revision, and post-generation output validation, along with evaluation scripts and
  reproducibility artifacts.
